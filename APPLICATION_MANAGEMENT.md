# Investment Tracker Application Management

## Overview
The `scripts/app.sh` is a unified application management tool that combines and enhances the functionality of the previous separate start scripts into a single, comprehensive solution. This document covers the complete implementation, usage, and migration details.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Command Structure
```bash
./scripts/app.sh COMMAND [OPTIONS]

Commands:
- start [server|client|all]    # Start components [default: all]
- stop [server|client|all]     # Stop components [default: all]
- force-stop                   # Emergency force stop all processes
- restart [server|client|all]  # Restart components [default: all]
- status                       # Show current application status

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Direct Script Usage
```bash
# Start everything (auto-detects environment)
./scripts/app.sh start

# Start only server
./scripts/app.sh start server

# Start only client (development mode only)
./scripts/app.sh start client

# Stop everything
./scripts/app.sh stop

# Emergency stop (force kill all processes)
./scripts/app.sh force-stop

# Restart everything
./scripts/app.sh restart

# Check status
./scripts/app.sh status

# View last 50 lines of all logs
./scripts/app.sh logs

# View last 100 lines of server logs
./scripts/app.sh logs server 100

# View client logs (development mode)
./scripts/app.sh logs client

# View all logs with custom line count
./scripts/app.sh logs all 200
```

### NPM Script Integration
```bash
# Start application
npm run app:start

# Stop application
npm run app:stop

# Restart application
npm run app:restart

# Check status
npm run app:status

# View logs
npm run app:logs

# Direct access to script
npm run app
```

## üåç Environment Modes

### Development Mode
- **Detection**: No built files present in `server/dist/` and `client/dist/`
- **Server**: Runs `npm run dev` with hot reloading
- **Client**: Runs `npm run dev` on port 5173
- **Process Management**: Separate processes for server and client
- **URLs**: 
  - Client: http://localhost:5173
  - Server: http://localhost:3002
  - API: http://localhost:3002/api

### Production Mode
- **Detection**: Built files present in `server/dist/` and `client/dist/`
- **Server**: Runs built Node.js application (`node dist/index.js`)
- **Client**: Served as static files by server
- **Process Management**: Single process serving everything
- **URLs**:
  - Application: http://localhost:3002
  - API: http://localhost:3002/api

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

### For Development Mode
- Node.js dependencies installed (`npm run setup`)
- Server and client `node_modules` present
- No built files required

### For Production Mode
- Built application files (`npm run build`)
- Database migrated (`npm run db:migrate`)
- All dependencies installed
- Production environment variables configured

## üîß Advanced Features

### Process Monitoring
- Tracks actual process status, not just PID files
- Validates process health before reporting status
- Automatic cleanup of stale PID files

### Log Management
- Centralized logging for easy log management
- Log rotation ready structure
- Component-specific log separation
- Configurable log viewing with line limits

### Health Checks
- Built-in health check endpoint monitoring
- Process validation before status reporting
- Dependency validation before starting

### Flexible Component Control
- Start/stop individual components
- Component-specific restart capabilities
- Emergency force-stop for all processes

## üö® Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Dependencies not installed"**
   - **Solution**: Run `npm run setup`
   - **Cause**: Missing node_modules directories

2. **"Production build not found"**
   - **Solution**: Run `npm run build`
   - **Cause**: Attempting production mode without built files

3. **"Database not found"**
   - **Solution**: Run `npm run db:migrate`
   - **Cause**: Database not initialized

4. **Process won't stop**
   - **Solution**: Use `./scripts/app.sh force-stop`
   - **Cause**: Process not responding to graceful shutdown

### Debug Information
```bash
# Check what's running
./scripts/app.sh status

# View recent logs for troubleshooting
./scripts/app.sh logs all 100

# Force clean restart
./scripts/app.sh force-stop
./scripts/app.sh start

# Check specific component logs
./scripts/app.sh logs server 200
```
